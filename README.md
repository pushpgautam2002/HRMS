README – HRMS Workforce & Manpower Cost Intelligence Dashboard

Asset Class: Enterprise Workforce Economics Intelligence
Environment: Microsoft Power BI
Version: 2025 (AUG) – Production

1) Executive Intent

This dashboard operationalizes month-over-month manpower economics as a Rate + Mix + Cost story.

It is not just a “HR headcount view” — it is a CFO-compatible cost instrumentation layer for workforce decisioning.

It quantifies:

manpower composition by department & mode

salary OPEX drivers (Total → Per Person → MoM Delta)

structural manpower split (On-Record vs Console vs Contractor)

attrition trendline (macro headcount health)

This converts headcount from HR reporting → Financial asset class classification.

2) Strategic Questions This Dashboard Solves
Pillar	Questions
Cost Control	Where is monthly salary cost expanding or collapsing?
Workforce Structure	What % of workforce is FT vs Contract vs Console?
Unit Economics	What is the real cost per employee in each segment?
Org Design	Are some departments structurally cost heavy vs output?
Run Rate Risk	Is attrition rate drifting upward silently?
3) Page Architecture
Page	Scope
Overview	Total workforce, salary contribution split, PF/ESI contribution health
Admin	Admin headcount + pay distribution + MoM delta
D2C	D2C manpower economics vs output requirements
Domestic	Domestic manpower cost / per head rate trajectory
Overseas	Overseas structure — FX-sensitive, export wage exposure
Manufacturing & Office Support	core production salary engine — this is the P&L heartbeat
Contractor	contractor wage payout + per contractor utilization
Unified Matrix	aggregated manpower cost matrix — Admin vs Direct, % cost composition, Attrition trend
4) KPIs Tracked
KPI	Definition
Total Workforce	Count across modes
Total Gross Salary	Full payout before deductions
Net Pay	Cash to employee post statutory deductions
Total PF / ESI contribution	statutory expense burden
Pay per Person	Core unit economics metric
MoM Salary Δ	month over month salary growth / shrink
MoM Pay per Person Δ	rate change at individual productivity level
Attrition Rate	exiting manpower % trend
5) Why This Is Strategically Material

This dashboard brings FP&A discipline into HR.

This enables:

CFO → to see whether manpower inflation is structural

COO → to see if production wage is aligned to throughput

COO → to identify whether contractor mix should be optimized

CHRO → to shift manpower planning from gut → quant

6) Operational Usage Patterns
Cadence	Usage
Monthly HR Ops	deep dive + manpower plan alignment
QBR with Finance	manpower cost as OPEX growth lever / compression lever
Vendor / Contract Rate Negotiation	contractor panel rationalization
Annual Workforce Planning	hiring freeze / conversion / shift to FT decisions

8) Interpretation Warning

If Pay Per Person MoM rises without Total Salary MoM rising proportionally — you have a mix shift risk (higher paid employees dominating).

If attrition slope breaks above base line → immediate CHRO escalation.
